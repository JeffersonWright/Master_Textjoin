This is a script that clears all the fields that text would usually be entered into, and resets the values of some cells that would be changed.
I made this beacuse it is much quicker and simpler than deleting the inputs manually, but most importantly because it preps the sheet so that the next use doesn't produce unexpected results.

This script is intended to be used with the sheet created from the Master_Textjoin function.

I use this function every time I am finished joining text, and since I use it quite often I have mapped it to a button on the sheet.
To create a button that runs the script follow this tutorial:
